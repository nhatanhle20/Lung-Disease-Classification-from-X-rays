# Lung-Disease-Classification-from-X-rays
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning-based system to classify lung diseases using chest X-ray images. Leveraging the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, the system was designed to identify various thoracic pathologies through image classification techniques. This project implements both Binary and Multi-label classification.
